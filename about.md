# About me

Hi, I'm Dominic. I'm a digital marketing and project management professional, specializing in B2B. With over 15 years of experience, I'm well versed in creating, implementing and executing marketing strategy. From social media to high converting email campaigns, I can help build your business build awareness with an emphasis on conversion.

Additionally, I've lead multiple projects to research, scope and manage as a technical lead or Scrum Master with experience in both waterfall and agile methodologies.

When not digging into digital marketing, KPI's, analytics or data governance, you'll find me in my homelab. As an avid tech enthusiast and hopeless desktop Linux romantic, I love to get nerdy.

Over ten years ago I felt this calling towards digital marketing. Back in the early days of social media, YouTube, and smartphones, I fell in love with this industry and found it irresistible. These new tools and platforms gave power to everyone. We could all go out and make whatever we wanted, with only ourselves to stop us.

I'm a firm believer that anyone is capable of anything. You, me, or anyone else can achieve our dreams and we only need three things to do it.

- The will and desire to do what it takes.
- A teacher, coach, or mentor to help us get there.
- Permission.

At the time, I was the manager of a wholesale distribution warehouse. But, I saw the potential small businesses had with the power of digital marketing. I dove in head first, soaking up any and all information I could find about marketing. Lucky for me, the internet was my teacher.

Being self-taught it is also important to me to continue to inspire others to join the digital marketing industry and connect with all the great information out there made by some incredible people. For the last year I've created and curated a newsletter all about digital marketing, being a coach and a leader to other marketing professionals, and how small businesses can use these digital tools to help them grow.


### Tech Enthusiast

In no way am I a digital native. After graduating high school, my only internet experience was making my MySpace page as loud as possible and finding websites that explained how to get viruses off my eMachines Windows XP desktop. I had a vision to where I wanted to be, and I had to get much better with modern technology.

Luckily both Linux and the open-source world were there to teach me. For hours I taught myself the ins-and-outs of computing. The open-source world is full of people willing to help and I quickly grew to managing servers on my LAN then to the cloud. With Linux, apps, software and pretty much everything else in the FOSS world being free (as in cost and free as in freedom), I was able to explore endlessly.

Growing up with little resources and then starting my own family on tight budgets has taught me a lot. When I first started learning about tech I would go to the Washington State Surplus store and purchase old Dell towers. Each tower would be converted into a Linux desktop or Kodi box. I've never had a budget for the latest and greatest, but I know what tech makes possible.  

### My HomeLab

Nearly all of my infrastructure and tech stack is made from recycled components, parts or machines. Its easy to just buy the latest and greatest off the shelf, always throwing more expensive hardware at problems. Where I find the challenge is using what you have available and maximizing the output. The specs in my homelab may not be impressive, but I get an impressive amount of output.

As of April 2020 this is my current lab.
