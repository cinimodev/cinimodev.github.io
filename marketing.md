# Marketer by Trade

Results driven, performance oriented team and project manager with 14+ years of proven experience. Ability to work cross-team, cross-function while maintaining long-term vision leveraging analytics within every process. Highly respected leader and coach, building trust across the entire stack.

In constant pursuit of personal development. I produce a digital marketing newsletter, podcast and blogs. This includes additional blogs, podcasts and videos for technology topics. Full stack management of these including back-end server administration, pipeline, plus content creation.

Although my work history is in the landscape industry, I am fascinated with technology and the open web. Whether it be mobile convergence, server and system administration or just cool gadgets, I regularly find myself absorbed into the latest technology.

On weekends and evenings, you can find me working in my home lab, building and experimenting with Linux servers, Arduino’s, Raspberry Pi’s, and more. I believe computers can change people’s lives. I enjoy rummaging around old computers and phones, then repairing and giving away to anyone is in need.

When not in my lab, you can find me on the trail, camping in the forest or enjoying classic 80s action movies that are so-bad-they’re-good. I am always looking for ways to create and connect with other people.

## Content Marketing
I believe one of my strongest skills is taking a complex topic and making it accessible for all audiences. Then, in addition to the blog, creating companion content to broaden the reach and optimize for long-tail keywords. 

Here are some writing samples:

[How to Prevent Fertilizer Burn During the Summer Months](https://news.ewingirrigation.com/blog/how-to-prevent-fertilizer-burn-during-the-summer-months/)  
At my time at Ewing Irrigation one of my core competencies was agronomics. In this blog I wrote about how to apply fertilizer during the summer months and reduce the potential for burn from the warm temperatures and nitrogen release.
[Marketing for Landscape Contractors - Finding Your Target Audience](https://corrteksolutions.com/blog/marketing-for-landscape-contractors-finding-your-target-audience/2020/12/18/)  
This is a blog I wrote for my own website that serves as an introduction to marketing for landscapers, including some basic steps to take.
[The Complete Guide to Home and Auto Insurance during Freezing Weather](https://crossinsuranceagency.com/the-complete-guide-to-home-and-auto-insurance-during-freezing-weather/)  
A recent blog for Cross Insurance Agency that includes some technical insurance information, plus a companion video I produced and links to several other blogs I have written for them.
