Hi, I'm Dominic. I'm the owner of [CorrTek Marketing Solutions](https://corrteksolutions.com) and a digital marketing and project management professional. I am also the co-owner of a landscape and irrigation contracting business with my brother called [The Sprinkler Geeks](https://thesprinklergeek.com).

I love to talk tech. In particular, I am fascinated by Linux, reviving old hardware, while preserving our privacy. I am also hard-of-hearing and wear dual hearing aids. Being hearing disabled has greatly affected my life and is a driver for helping make sure tech and marketing are always accessible. 

This repository is my blog, tech notes, and general musings of my life. I also produce videos, podcasts, and occasionally post on social media.
